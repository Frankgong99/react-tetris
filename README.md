## Features

- **Keyboard Controls:** Players can use the keyboard to control the movement and rotation of Tetrominoes.
- **Dynamic Difficulty:** The game's difficulty increases progressively as the player clears more lines. The speed of Tetrominoes falling increases with the level.
- **High Score Tracking:** Utilizes browser local storage to record and display the highest score achieved.
